                            This <br> passive has a cooldown of 5 seconds.

                            With this passive, Chip really benefits, especially in rotation conditions. 
                            He will get <br> additional laughter when he changes lanes and is in good enough condition to <br> fight on another lane .</p>

                        <p>After this skill is activated, the resulting basic attack will then be long range. 
                            If the <br> basic attack hits all enemies around the mark, 
                            the mark will explode and give <br> magic damage and a stun effect for 0.5 seconds.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Chip smashes the hovercraft he is riding in to the ground, 
                            producing Magic <br> Damage and giving a Mark to the enemy hero who is hit.  
                            After casting this skill, <br> Chip also gets a Shield which increases along with the number of enemies <br> affected by this skill.</p>

                            After that, it will enter charge mode. In this mode, 
                            basic <br> attacks on the enemy provide magic damage and a knockback effect.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Apart from providing a CC effect towards the enemy, 
                            this skill can also be used to <br> increase speed so that the rotation process to another lane takes place more <br> quickly.</p>

                            Along with that, a connecting portal will appear <br> near teammates. 
                            The main portal and connecting portal will last up to 10 seconds.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Either enemies or teammates can teleport from the connecting portal to the main <br> portal, 
                            or stand at the main portal for a certain period of time to return to their <br> original location. 
                            The main portal can cause damage to nearby enemies after a <br> delay and provide an airborne effect after a short delay . 
                            The main portal has 80% <br> of the total life of the Chip itself.</p>

                        <p>Chip also has a special skill called Why Walk. 
                            The effect of this skill is that every <br> time this hero appears in a match, 
                            4 beacons will automatically appear in the <br> game. With this beacon, 
                            he can teleport to other beacon positions . To activate <br> this beacon, 
                            he must stand on the beacon, and have the portal number he wants <br> to go to.</p>

                            players must be careful and think carefully about the time and position <br> needed to use this skill.</p>
